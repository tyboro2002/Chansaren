# Chansaren
A card game all based on luck (chansd in a dutch dialect from there chansaren).
All cards are dealed to the players at the start of the game they need to keep their decks face down.
Each turn the playing player can choose to lay 1, 2 or 3 cards face up on the table of the top of their face down deck. All the other players need to lay the same amount (if their deck is large enough (otherwise only lay the cards you have)).
when theire are cards on the table their are rules aplied to the cards to determine who wins the round.
rules:
    - when there are 2 sevens on the table (all decks combined) the decks of the players loop around
    - when a player lays a 2 he has to immediately lay an extra card that counts for 2 times the value (stacks when a extra 2 is layed on the 2)
    - when a player lays a jack he gets the top card of all other players deck to put on top of his deck
    - when a queen and king are on the table both in different decks there will be needed some bodyguards so each of them lay on a extra card.
    - when a player has 3 sixes in his deck it forms a 666 the number of the devil. He kills all humans on the table so remove all jack's, queen's and king's.
    - when a player has 2 cards with the same value it needs to recieve a card of the other players cards on the table (when multiple double cards are on a players deck recieve the same amount of cards as if you have double cards)
when all rules are aplied (when extra cards are placed or cards are moved recheck all rules) theire are some special cases in wich a player wins.
special cases:
    - when a player has only 1 ace and no other cards this player is automaticaly won
    - when a player has consecutive cards this player is won (when multiple players have this the lowest one wins)
if no of this special cases are met the player with the largest value of deck wins (cards layed on a 2 counts times 2 a jack is 11 queen is 12 king is 13) (an extra card need to be layed when there is a draw by the players causing the draw)
the player that wins need to gather all cards and place them on the bottom of their deck.
